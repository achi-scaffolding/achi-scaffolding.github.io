                <h2>Ancient Foundations</h2>
            </div>

            <p>
                The roots of scaffolding in Lebanon trace back to ancient civilizations. Early structures, such 
                as the Phoenician cities and Roman ruins, offer glimpses into the rudimentary yet innovative 
                scaffolding methods used for monumental constructions. These historic sites stand as a testament 
                to the ingenuity of early builders and the fundamental role of scaffolding in their endeavors.

                <h2>Medieval Innovations</h2>
            </div>

            <p>
                During the medieval period, Lebanon saw the rise of innovative architectural styles that demanded 
                more sophisticated scaffolding solutions. The influence of Islamic architecture and the construction 
                of landmarks like the Beiteddine Palace and the Byblos Castle marked a pivotal phase in scaffolding 
                techniques, showcasing advancements in design and construction methods.
